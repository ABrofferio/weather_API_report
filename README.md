#weather_API_report
I have written a program in Python3.5 that pulls June weather data from the Forecast.io API and creates a web-based report detailing the usage data for an HVAC system. The program incorporates a Python Wrapper Library by Zeâ€™ev Gilovitz found on the API documentation page for Forecast.io and several python modules.

###Installation
My code requires an installation of requests: 
$ pip3 install requests

To start the program, open and run the WorkSampleTest.py file. Once the program is running, data will populate on the console and a web-based report will open in the browser.
